# Credit Usage Tracking - Property-Based Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the property-based testing implementation for credit usage tracking in the Seiron frontend HiveIntelligenceAdapter.

## Overview

The credit usage tracking system has been extensively tested using **fast-check**, a property-based testing library that generates thousands of test cases to validate system behavior under various conditions. This approach ensures robust credit handling across all adapter methods.

## Test Files

### 1. CreditUsageTracking.property.test.ts
**Purpose**: Core credit usage tracking functionality
**Test Count**: 16 property-based tests
**Coverage**:
- Credit value validation (non-negative, integer constraints)
- Credit accumulation across all adapter methods
- Edge cases with zero/negative credits
- Credit consistency and reporting
- Concurrent request handling
- Error scenarios without credit reporting

**Key Properties Tested**:
- All credit values are non-negative integers
- Credit accumulation is consistent across methods
- Zero credits are handled gracefully
- Negative credits from API are passed through (documented behavior)
- Credit metadata is always present in successful responses
- Failed requests don't report credit usage

### 2. CreditAccumulation.property.test.ts
**Purpose**: Credit calculation and aggregation utilities
**Test Count**: 21 property-based tests
**Coverage**:
- Credit validation functions
- Credit normalization and edge case handling
- Mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity)
- Credit conservation laws
- Aggregation across multiple sources
- Operation cost calculations

**Key Properties Tested**:
- Credit validation correctly identifies valid/invalid values
- Credit normalization handles Infinity, NaN, negative values
- Credit accumulation is commutative and associative
- Credit conservation: `total = used + remaining`
- Aggregation maintains mathematical consistency
- Operation costs scale with complexity

### 3. CreditEdgeCases.property.test.ts
**Purpose**: Edge cases and stress testing
**Test Count**: 11 property-based tests (1 skipped)
**Coverage**:
- Extreme credit values (very large, Infinity, NaN)
- Malformed API responses
- Network error scenarios
- Concurrent access patterns
- Credit quota enforcement
- Recovery from errors
- Performance under load

**Key Properties Tested**:
- Extreme values don't crash the system
- Malformed responses are handled gracefully
- Network errors don't corrupt credit state
- Concurrent requests maintain independent credit reporting
- Credit exhaustion scenarios are handled properly
- System recovers from credit-related errors

## Arbitraries (Test Data Generators)

### Credit Value Arbitraries
```typescript
// Valid credit values (0 to 1000)
arbitraryCredits()

// Edge cases including zero, negative, very large
arbitraryCreditsWithEdgeCases()

// Extreme values including Infinity, NaN
arbitraryExtremeCreditValues()

// Invalid credit values for validation testing
arbitraryInvalidCredits()
```

### Complex Data Structure Arbitraries
```typescript
// Complete credit usage data structure
arbitraryCreditUsage()

// Analytics results with credit metadata
arbitraryAnalyticsResult()

// Adapter method configurations
arbitraryAdapterMethod()

// Malformed response data for error testing
arbitraryMalformedCreditResponse()
```

## Property-Based Testing Patterns

### 1. Mathematical Properties
- **Commutativity**: `a + b = b + a`
- **Associativity**: `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`
- **Identity**: `a + 0 = a`
- **Conservation**: `total = used + remaining`

### 2. Error Handling Properties
- **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid inputs don't crash
- **Error Isolation**: Failures don't affect other operations
- **Recovery**: System continues after errors

### 3. Concurrency Properties
- **Independence**: Concurrent requests don't interfere
- **Consistency**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Isolation**: Partial failures don't corrupt global state

## Test Execution

### Running Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Main credit tracking tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="CreditUsageTracking.property.test.ts"

# Credit accumulation utilities
npm test -- --testPathPattern="CreditAccumulation.property.test.ts"

# Edge cases and stress tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="CreditEdgeCases.property.test.ts"

# All credit-related property tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="Credit.*\.property\.test\.ts"
```

### Test Configuration
- **Default runs per property**: 100 (can be customized)
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds for long-running tests
- **Shrinking**: Automatic counterexample minimization
- **Seeds**: Reproducible test runs for debugging

## Key Insights from Property-Based Testing

### 1. Discovered Behaviors
- The adapter currently passes through negative credit values from the API
- Credit metadata structure is robust to missing fields
- Concurrent requests maintain proper isolation
- Error scenarios don't leak credit information

### 2. Edge Cases Identified
- Very large credit values (near MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
- Malformed API responses with non-numeric credit values
- Network timeouts during credit-intensive operations
- Credit exhaustion scenarios

### 3. Mathematical Guarantees
- Credit accumulation is commutative and associative
- Credit conservation laws are maintained
- Zero and negative credit handling is consistent
- Operation costs scale predictably with complexity

## Integration with CI/CD

### Test Coverage Metrics
The property-based tests provide:
- **Input space coverage**: Thousands of generated test cases
- **Edge case coverage**: Systematic exploration of boundary conditions
- **Error path coverage**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Concurrency coverage**: Multi-threaded access patterns

### Performance Characteristics
- **Execution time**: ~3-5 seconds for all property tests
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (fast-check is efficient)
- **Deterministic**: Uses seeds for reproducible runs
- **Scalable**: Can increase/decrease test runs as needed

## Functional Programming Integration

### fp-ts Integration
The tests leverage functional programming patterns:
```typescript
import * as E from 'fp-ts/Either'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// Error handling with Either
const validateCredits = (credits: number): E.Either<string, number>

// Optional value handling
const normalizeCredits = (credits: number): number
```

### Immutability
All test data is immutable, ensuring:
- No side effects between tests
- Predictable test behavior
- Easy reasoning about test logic
- Thread-safe concurrent testing

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Property Definition
- Clear property statements with mathematical precision
- Focus on "what should be true" rather than "how it works"
- Separation of concerns (values, accumulation, edge cases)

### 2. Test Organization
- Logical grouping by functionality
- Comprehensive documentation within tests
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper setup/teardown for each test group

### 3. Error Scenario Testing
- Systematic coverage of failure modes
- Verification that errors don't corrupt state
- Testing of recovery mechanisms
- Proper error message validation

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Properties
- Credit rate limiting behavior
- Long-term credit usage patterns
- Cross-adapter credit tracking
- Credit audit trail verification

### 2. Performance Properties
- Credit processing latency bounds
- Memory usage patterns
- Throughput under various loads
- Resource cleanup verification

### 3. Security Properties
- Credit information isolation
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Data sanitization verification
- Audit log integrity

## Debugging Failed Properties

When a property fails, fast-check provides:
1. **Counterexample**: The specific input that caused failure
2. **Shrinking**: Minimal failing case
3. **Seed**: For reproducing the exact failure
4. **Path**: The sequence of decisions that led to failure

Example debugging workflow:
```typescript
// Property failed with seed: -855859441, counterexample: [-1]
// Run with verbose mode for detailed information
fc.assert(property, { 
  seed: -855859441, 
  path: "0:0", 
  verbose: true 
})
```

## Conclusion

The property-based testing implementation for credit usage tracking provides:
- **Comprehensive coverage** of input space and edge cases
- **Mathematical guarantees** about system behavior
- **Confidence** in concurrent and error scenarios
- **Documentation** of system properties and constraints
- **Regression protection** through automated property verification

This approach significantly improves the reliability and robustness of the credit tracking system while providing clear documentation of expected behavior under all conditions.
