# GLTF Model Corruption Issue

## Problem Description

The file `/models/seiron_animated.gltf` is corrupted due to a truncated binary buffer file.

### Technical Details

- **Expected buffer size**: 7,166,968 bytes (7.1MB)
- **Actual buffer size**: 550,472 bytes (550KB)
- **Size difference**: 6,616,496 bytes missing
- **Error message**: "Invalid typed array length: 773"

The GLTF file references buffer views that exceed the actual binary file size, causing Three.js to fail when creating typed arrays.

## Impact

When attempting to load `seiron_animated.gltf`, the application throws an error and the 3D model fails to render. The specific error occurs when Three.js tries to create typed arrays with count 773 from buffer views that point beyond the end of the truncated binary file.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Model Status Updated**: The model has been marked as `deprecated` in the configuration
2. **Fallback Chain**: Updated to use working alternatives:
   - Primary: `seiron_animated_optimized.gltf` (917KB)
   - Secondary: `seiron_animated_lod_high.gltf` (998KB)
   - Tertiary: `seiron.glb` (1.8MB)
   - Emergency: 2D/ASCII dragons

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection for:
   - Invalid typed array errors
   - GLTF parsing errors
   - Corrupted file detection

4. **Default Model Changed**: The default model is now `seiron_animated_optimized.gltf`

## Available Working Models

| Model | Path | Size | Format | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Seiron Animated Optimized | `/models/seiron_animated_optimized.gltf` | 917KB | GLTF | ✅ Working |
| Seiron LOD High | `/models/seiron_animated_lod_high.gltf` | 998KB | GLTF | ✅ Working |
| Seiron Primary | `/models/seiron.glb` | 1.8MB | GLB | ✅ Working |
| Seiron Optimized | `/models/seiron_optimized.glb` | 167KB | GLB | ✅ Working |
| Dragon Head | `/models/dragon_head.glb` | 706KB | GLB | ✅ Working |
| Dragon Head Optimized | `/models/dragon_head_optimized.glb` | 109KB | GLB | ✅ Working |

## How to Fix the Corrupted File

To fix `seiron_animated.gltf`, you need to:

1. Obtain the complete binary file (should be 7.1MB)
2. Replace the truncated `seiron_animated.bin` file
3. Verify the file size matches the buffer declaration in the GLTF
4. Test loading in Three.js

## Prevention

1. Use Git LFS for large binary files
2. Verify file integrity after uploads/downloads
3. Use GLB format (self-contained) instead of GLTF+BIN when possible
4. Implement checksum validation for critical model files
