# WalletConnect Implementation

This document describes the implementation of WalletConnect Core initialization fix to prevent duplicate initialization warnings.

## Problem

The console was showing warnings like:
```
WalletConnect Core is already initialized. This is probably a mistake and can lead to unexpected behavior. Init() was called 2 times.
```

This was happening because:
1. React.StrictMode in development causes double mounting
2. Hot module replacement in development can cause multiple initializations
3. Privy internally uses WalletConnect but doesn't have proper singleton pattern
4. No proper cleanup was implemented

## Solution

### 1. WalletConnect Manager (`utils/walletConnectManager.ts`)

Created a singleton pattern manager that:
- Prevents duplicate initialization
- Handles cleanup for hot module replacement
- Filters WalletConnect warnings in development
- Provides proper initialization state management

Key features:
- Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance
- Async initialization with proper error handling
- Cleanup handlers for development hot reload
- Warning filter for development mode

### 2. WalletConnect Provider (`components/wallet/WalletConnectProvider.tsx`)

React context provider that:
- Manages WalletConnect initialization state
- Provides hooks for components to access initialization status
- Handles proper cleanup on unmount
- Supports error states

### 3. Updated Main Application (`main.tsx`)

Enhanced the main application to:
- Initialize WalletConnect before rendering
- Prevent double mounting in development
- Handle async initialization errors gracefully
- Provide proper cleanup for hot reload

### 4. Updated Wagmi Configuration (`config/wagmi.ts`)

Added proper WalletConnect connector configuration:
- Only initializes WalletConnect if project ID is provided
- Includes proper metadata for WalletConnect
- Logs configuration status for debugging

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The WalletConnect manager is automatically initialized in `main.tsx`. No manual initialization is required.

### Using the Provider

```typescript
import { WalletConnectProvider, useWalletConnect } from '@/components/wallet/WalletConnectProvider'

function MyComponent() {
  const { isInitialized, isInitializing, error } = useWalletConnect()
  
  if (isInitializing) return <div>Initializing...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
  if (!isInitialized) return <div>Not initialized</div>
  
  return <div>WalletConnect ready!</div>
}

// Wrap your app with the provider
<WalletConnectProvider>
  <MyComponent />
</WalletConnectProvider>
```

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

## Files Modified

1. **`utils/walletConnectManager.ts`** - New singleton manager
2. **`components/wallet/WalletConnectProvider.tsx`** - New React provider
3. **`components/wallet/WalletConnectExample.tsx`** - Example component
4. **`main.tsx`** - Updated initialization logic
5. **`config/wagmi.ts`** - Added WalletConnect connector
6. **`components/wallet/index.ts`** - Export new components
7. **`utils/webglDiagnostics.ts`** - Fixed TypeScript errors
8. **`utils/webglRecovery.ts`** - Fixed TypeScript errors
9. **`utils/errorRecovery.ts`** - Fixed type definitions

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for the WalletConnect provider
- Integration tests for the initialization flow
- Error handling tests

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="WalletConnect"
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Warnings**: Eliminates duplicate initialization warnings
2. **Better Development Experience**: Handles hot reload properly
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when WalletConnect fails
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
5. **React Integration**: Proper React context and hooks
6. **Performance**: Singleton pattern prevents unnecessary re-initialization

## Notes

- The implementation is backwards compatible
- Works with both development and production builds
- Handles React.StrictMode properly
- Includes proper cleanup for memory management
- Logs initialization status for debugging
