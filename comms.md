## Agent Workflow Instructions (Following claude.md)

**CRITICAL: Each agent MUST follow this process for EVERY task:**

1. **THINK FIRST** - Use explicit `<thinking>` blocks to understand the task deeply
2. **RESEARCH** - Investigate existing solutions, best practices, and technical requirements
3. **PLAN** - Create a detailed implementation plan with subtasks
4. **SPAWN SUBAGENTS** - Use the Task tool to create specialized subagents for each subtask
5. **INTEGRATE** - Combine subagent outputs into a cohesive solution
6. **VALIDATE** - Ensure all requirements are met before passing to the next agent

### Subagent Usage Pattern

```
For each major component:
1. Spawn a Research Subagent → gather technical requirements and best practices
2. Spawn a Design Subagent → create architecture and schemas
3. Spawn Implementation Subagents → build specific features
4. Spawn a Testing Subagent → validate functionality
5. Spawn a Documentation Subagent → create comprehensive docs
```

## Project Goal

You are a team of AI Claude code agents collaborating to build a voice-enabled chat page for an existing Sei blockchain investment platform. This chat page provides real-time voice conversations about Sei investment opportunities using ElevenLabs, maintains conversation memory with Vercel KV, and integrates with existing Hive MCP and Sei Agent MCP services. The page must seamlessly integrate into the existing website infrastructure.

**REMEMBER: Before implementing ANY component, you MUST:**
- Think through the implications and dependencies
- Research similar implementations
- Plan the architecture
- Spawn appropriate subagents via the Task tool
- Follow claude.md best practices

## Action Log

**IMPORTANT: Each agent MUST document their thinking process and subagent usage**

<agent_id>Agent 1</agent_id>
<thinking>
Need to create the foundation for the voice chat page within an existing Next.js 15 application. Must focus solely on the chat page implementation, ensuring it integrates smoothly with existing infrastructure. Following claude.md guidelines for proper documentation and thinking blocks.
</thinking>
<research>
Will spawn subagents to research Next.js 15 App Router patterns, ElevenLabs v2 API changes, Vercel KV best practices, and modern voice UI implementations.
</research>
<task_completed>

</task_completed>
<next_task>
Create the initial `/chat` route structure with proper Next.js 15 App Router setup.

REQUIRED PROCESS:
1. THINK about optimal server/client component separation
2. RESEARCH Next.js 15 patterns using Research Subagents
3. PLAN the page structure with a Design Subagent
4. SPAWN Implementation Subagents for route setup
5. SPAWN a UI/UX Subagent for initial component structure
6. INTEGRATE components and create initial tests

Include page.tsx, layout.tsx, loading.tsx, and error.tsx with proper TypeScript types. Set up initial client components structure. Once complete, assign the next task to Agent 2: Implement the voice recording component with Web Audio API.
</next_task>
<prompt>
Remember to use proper thinking blocks as per claude.md. Focus on the chat page integration within the existing app. Research the latest Next.js 15 features like improved Server Actions and the new 'use' hook. Your subagents should cover: App Router patterns, streaming SSR, edge runtime optimization, and component architecture.

<findings>
**CSS Import Issues Resolved:**
- Removed `@import './dragon-sprites.css';` from globals.css (line 6) 
- Removed `@import './dragon-summoning.css';` from globals.css (line 8)
- These files were leftover references from previous development iterations
- Functionality already implemented elsewhere (storm-animations.css for summoning, placeholder for sprites)

**Vite Optimization Warnings:**
- `chunk-SWTKYVT5.js` warnings are known Vite 5.x+ issues, not codebase-specific
- Warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality
- No action needed - current vite.config.ts is properly configured

**Development Server Status:**
- Server now starts successfully at http://localhost:3000/
- No blocking CSS import errors
- Normal Vite startup time (~108ms)
- Ready for development work
</findings>
<current_state>
Development server operational. CSS import errors that were preventing startup have been resolved by removing references to non-existent files. The Dragon Ball Z themed voice chat functionality remains intact with existing implementations.

## Console Error Suppression Fixed
<timestamp>2025-07-19</timestamp>
<task>Fix generic_error on /chat page with no console logs</task>
<status>✅ COMPLETE</status>
<agent>Assistant</agent>
<changes>
**Issue Found:**
- walletConnectManager.ts was globally overriding console.error, suppressing all error messages
- setupConsoleFilters() was being called on module load, affecting the entire application

**Root Causes:**
1. Line 166 in walletConnectManager.ts was calling setupConsoleFilters() immediately on module load
2. console.error override was too aggressive, catching all errors not just WalletConnect ones
3. No cleanup was being called when components unmounted

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Modified `/frontend/utils/walletConnectManager.ts`:
   - Made console.error filter more specific to only suppress WalletConnect initialization errors
   - Added check to not suppress generic_error messages
   - Commented out auto-initialization of console filters on module load (lines 166-168)

2. Modified `/frontend/components/wallet/WalletConnectProvider.tsx`:
   - Added cleanup call in useEffect return to restore console functions when provider unmounts

3. Fixed import path inconsistencies:
   - Updated imports in MinimalChatInterface.tsx from @lib/utils to @/lib/utils
   - Updated imports in GameDialogueBox.tsx from @lib/utils to @/lib/utils
   - Updated imports in useChatStream.ts to use @/ prefix
   - Updated imports in vercel-chat-service.ts from @lib/logger to @/lib/logger
   - Updated imports in ChatErrorBoundary.tsx to use @/ prefix
   - Updated imports in ReactError310Handler.tsx to use @/ prefix
   - Updated imports in SeironImage.tsx to use @/ prefix

**Result:**
Console errors are now visible again. The generic_error should now show proper error messages in the console for debugging.
</changes>

## Recent Updates

### Video Integration After Lightning Sequence (Completed)
- Created `VideoPlayer` component in `frontend/components/effects/VideoPlayer.tsx`
- Added `video` phase to the summoning sequence in HomePage
- Integrated video playback between lightning and dragon arrival phases
- Added CSS styles for video overlay and transitions in `storm-animations.css`
- Created `frontend/public/videos/` directory for video assets
- Video file should be named `dragon-transition.mp4` and placed in the videos directory

The video will now automatically play after the lightning sequence completes and before the dragon arrives.

### Video Playback Debugging (Completed)
- Added base `.summoning-overlay` CSS class with proper display and positioning
- Fixed video container z-index (10001) to ensure it appears above other elements
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
  - Phase transitions
  - Video loading states
  - Playback events
  - Error handling
- Enhanced background lightning effect to continue during video phase
- Video should now properly display after lightning sequence

**To test the video playback:**
1. Open browser console to see debug logs
2. Click "SUMMON" button
3. Watch for phase transitions: darkening → storm → lightning → video → arrival
4. Check console for any video loading errors or autoplay issues
