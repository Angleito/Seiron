## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Docker Logging Configuration
- **JSON logging driver** for all services with size and file rotation limits
- **Service-specific log volumes** for persistent storage
- **Environment-based log level configuration** (production, development, test)
- **Container health check logging** with configurable intervals

### 2. Centralized Log Aggregation
- **Fluent Bit integration** for real-time log collection and processing
- **Multi-environment support** with separate configurations
- **Log parsing and filtering** for different log formats (JSON, Redis, Nginx)
- **Service discovery** and automatic log routing

### 3. Environment Variables
- **LOG_LEVEL** - Global log level control (debug, info, warn, error)
- **LOG_FORMAT** - Output format selection (json, pretty, simple)
- **LOG_RETENTION_DAYS** - Configurable retention policies (default: 30 days)
- **ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING** - Performance metrics collection toggle
- **DEBUG flags** - Service-specific debugging controls

### 4. Log Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time error rate monitoring** with configurable thresholds
- **Performance metrics tracking** (response times, memory usage)
- **Disk usage monitoring** with warnings and critical alerts
- **Service health monitoring** with availability tracking
- **Automated alert generation** in JSON format

### 5. Backup and Retention
- **Automated log rotation** with compression after 7 days
- **Configurable retention policies** (7-90 days)
- **Compressed backup creation** with integrity verification
- **Backup metadata tracking** and cleanup

### 6. Log Analysis and Reporting
- **Error pattern analysis** identifying recurring issues
- **Performance metric analysis** tracking response times and throughput
- **Usage pattern analysis** monitoring traffic and user behavior
- **Automated report generation** with JSON output format

## Docker Service Configuration

### Production Environment
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "20m"
        max-file: "10"
        labels: "service=backend,env=production"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-info}
      - ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
```

### Development Environment
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "50m"
        max-file: "10"
        labels: "service=backend,env=development"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-debug}
      - ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING=true
```

### Test Environment
```yaml
services:
  backend-test:
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "20m"
        max-file: "5"
        labels: "service=backend-test,env=test"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-error}
      - ENABLE_TEST_LOGGING=true
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-logging.sh

# Copy logging configuration
cp .env.logging .env.local
```

### 2. Start Services with Logging
```bash
# Production
docker-compose up -d

# Development with enhanced logging
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Testing
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
```bash
# View aggregated logs
docker-compose logs -f log-aggregator

# Monitor specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend

# View log files directly
tail -f logs/combined.log
```

### 4. Run Analysis
```bash
# Generate analysis reports
./scripts/log-analysis.sh

# Create backups
./scripts/log-backup.sh

# View analysis results
ls -la logs/analysis/
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Grafana Dashboards
- **Service Overview** - Overall system health and performance
- **Error Analysis** - Error patterns and trends  
- **Performance Metrics** - Response times and throughput
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, and disk usage

### Prometheus Metrics
- Log ingestion rates
- Error rates by service
- Performance metrics
- System resource usage

### Alert Conditions
- Error rate exceeds 100 errors per 5-minute window
- Disk usage exceeds 80% (warning) or 90% (critical)
- Service health check failures
- Log aggregation failures

## Performance Optimizations

### Log Rotation
- Automatic rotation when files exceed 20MB (production) or 50MB (development)
- Compression of logs older than 7 days
- Automatic cleanup of logs older than retention period

### Buffer Management
- Fluent Bit buffer size: 50MB (production), 100MB (development)
- Flush interval: 1 second for real-time processing
- Memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Throttling
- Rate limiting: 1000 events/5min (production), 2000 events/1min (development)
- Error log filtering to reduce noise
- Performance metric sampling

## Security Features

### Log Sanitization
- Automatic removal of sensitive data (private keys, passwords)
- Wallet address masking in logs
- Request/response body sanitization

### Access Control
- File permissions: 644 for logs, 755 for directories
- Restricted access to backup and alert directories
- Secure log transmission and storage

## Maintenance Tasks

### Automated
- Log rotation and compression
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metric collection
- Backup creation and verification
- Old log cleanup

### Manual
- Weekly performance review
- Monthly backup verification
- Quarterly configuration optimization
- Analysis report review

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Visibility** - All logs aggregated in one location
2. **Structured Logging** - Consistent JSON format across all services
3. **Real-time Monitoring** - Immediate error detection and alerting
4. **Performance Insights** - Detailed metrics and analysis
5. **Operational Efficiency** - Automated maintenance and monitoring
6. **Debugging Support** - Rich contextual information for troubleshooting
7. **Compliance Ready** - Audit trails and retention policies
8. **Scalable Architecture** - Handles growing log volumes efficiently

The centralized logging system is now fully operational and provides comprehensive observability into the Seiron application's behavior, performance, and health across all environments.
