        "text": "For a $50k ETH/USDC position at current price $2,450, I recommend a dynamic range strategy enhanced with Symphony routing. Based on ETH's 30-day volatility of 0.62, optimal range would be $2,200-$2,750 (±11.5%). This captures ~85% of recent price action while maintaining 0.78 utilization rate. Expected fee APR: 28-35% at current volume. Symphony integration shows potential arbitrage opportunities worth additional 0.3-0.8% APY through cross-protocol execution. The wider range reduces impermanent loss risk to ~2.8% for 15% price moves. Consider the 0.05% fee tier for this range width. Rebalance triggers at 0.3 utilization or 7-day intervals, with automated arbitrage scanning every 30 seconds."

      "content": {
        "text": "Current ETH price $2,380 vs your range $2,500-$2,800 means 0% utilization - definitely rebalance. Gas costs ~$45 at current network conditions. New optimal range: $2,250-$2,550 based on recent volatility patterns and momentum indicators. This rebalancing will restore ~82% utilization and resume fee generation. Expected payback period: 3.2 days at current volume. Alternative: if you expect quick reversal above $2,500, wait max 24 hours, but opportunity cost is $12/day in lost fees."

        "text": "With ETH moving from $2,400 to $2,160 (-10%), your IL calculation: For a balanced 50/50 position, IL = 2.02%. Your specific range $2,200-$2,600 experienced asymmetric exposure due to concentration, resulting in 3.1% IL. However, you earned $340 in fees over this period, resulting in net positive return of +1.2%. The concentrated position actually outperformed hold strategy by 0.8%. Current position: 78% ETH, 22% USDC due to price movement."

    {
      "user": "What's the difference between narrow and wide range strategies?",
      "content": {
        "text": "Narrow ranges (±5-15%): Higher fee capture (2-5x), but increased IL risk and rebalancing frequency. Best for sideways markets with high volume. Example: 40-60% APR fees but 20-30% IL in trending markets. Wide ranges (±25-50%): Lower fees (0.5-2x hold), but minimal IL and rare rebalancing. Better for volatile/trending markets. My adaptive strategy combines both: start narrow in low volatility, widen during volatility spikes. With Symphony integration, I also factor in arbitrage frequency - narrow ranges in high-arbitrage environments can capture additional 0.2-0.5% daily through micro-arbitrage opportunities. Current market regime suggests medium-wide ranges (±20%) for optimal risk-adjusted returns."

Found 7 opportunities across protocols: 1) USDC/USDT cross-protocol: 0.18% profit on Symphony→Curve (2min window, 95% confidence). 2) ETH triangular: ETH→USDC→DAI→ETH yielding 0.43% after gas (~$340 profit on $80k volume). 3) SEI/WSEI spatial arbitrage: 0.28% on Symphony vs Astroport. Top recommendation: Execute triangular #2 immediately - high confidence, sufficient liquidity, gas-efficient route. Risk score: 0.23 (low). I can auto-execute if you enable permissions. Note: 3 opportunities expire within 90 seconds due to MEV competition."
