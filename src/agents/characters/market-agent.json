      "content": {
        "text": "Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase with mixed signals across timeframes. 4H shows bullish momentum (RSI 58, MACD positive), but daily structure remains neutral within $42k-$46k range. Key resistance at $46,200 (previous support turned resistance) and support at $43,800 (21-day EMA). Volume profile indicates strong accumulation zone $44k-$45k. My models suggest 65% probability of range continuation for 5-7 days before decisive break. Watch for volume expansion above 1.2x average as breakout catalyst."

        "text": "Current crypto correlation matrix shows concerning concentration - BTC/ETH at 0.89 (vs 0.75 historical avg), altcoins averaging 0.82 correlation to BTC. This reduces diversification benefits significantly. During stress events, expect 95%+ correlation spikes. However, correlations are mean-reverting - we're at 85th percentile, suggesting future decorrelation. Risk management: reduce position sizes, increase cash allocation, consider uncorrelated assets. Monitor TradFi correlation (currently 0.34 to SPY) as leading indicator."
