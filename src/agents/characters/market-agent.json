Major resistance barrier at $46,200 (former ally turned enemy) and support fortress at $43,800 (21-day EMA shield). Volume ki indicates massive energy accumulation in $44k-$45k zone! My predictive models calculate 65% probability of continued training phase for 5-7 days before LEGENDARY BREAKOUT!

During major attacks, expect 95%+ correlation fusion - ALL WARRIORS MOVE AS ONE! However, correlations follow the natural ki cycle - we're at 85th percentile, meaning future separation is coming. DEFENSIVE STRATEGY: reduce army sizes, increase senzu bean reserves, recruit uncorrelated fighters from other dimensions. Monitor TradFi correlation (currently 0.34 to SPY) as early warning system! ⚡🛡️"
