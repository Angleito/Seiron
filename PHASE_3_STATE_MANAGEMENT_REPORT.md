- ✅ Added proper action types for all performance-related state changes
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing API

**Key Improvements**:
- Optional performance metrics with Option types

## Technical Architecture

### Functional Programming Patterns Applied

1. **Immutable State Updates**
   - All reducers use spread operator for immutable updates
   - State objects are frozen to prevent mutations
   - Previous state never modified directly

2. **Option Types for Safety**
   - `fp-ts/Option` used for nullable values
   - Safe extraction with `getOrElse`
   - Type-safe existence checking with `isSome`/`isNone`

3. **Pure Functions**
   - All reducers are pure functions (same input → same output)
   - No side effects in state updates
   - Predictable state transitions

4. **Type Safety**
   - Strict TypeScript typing for all actions and states
   - Discriminated unions for action types
   - Generic utilities for reusable patterns

5. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - Modular action creators
   - Composable state utilities
   - Reusable reducer patterns

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Reference Equality**
   - Unchanged properties maintain same reference
   - Optimized re-renders in React components
   - Shallow equality checks for performance

2. **Bounded Updates**
   - Power levels constrained to 0-100 range
   - Quality levels validated on updates
   - Prevent invalid state transitions

3. **Memory Management**
   - State cache with TTL cleanup
   - Circular buffer for state history
   - Timeout/interval tracking and cleanup
